:mechanical_arm: I am currently learning Front-end programming.

:octopus: I am interested in everything connected to:
 - webpage design and structure

 - cross-browser and responsive design
 - code automation
 - HTTP requests
 - fixing bugs and testing

:fist_right::fist_left: I am currently looking for a Junior Front-end position to learn and work on real-life projects constantly interacting with a team.

:dancers: I am looking forward to meet people whose passion is Web-programming, those who are making their first steps in it as well as experienced developers ready to share their knowledge.

:mountain_bicyclist: I love learning new things, reading, old movies, yoga, hiking and dancing.
